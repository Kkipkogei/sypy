SyPy
====

A Python framework for evaluating graph-based Sybil detection algorithms in social and information networks.

SyPy provides basic abstractions to define a network consisting of two regions, a Sybil region and an honest region, each having its own graph structure. It supports many of the popular graph-based Sybil detection algorithms such as SybilGuard, SybilLimit, SybilInfer, and other proposals based on community detections such as Girvan-Newman and Lourain methods.
