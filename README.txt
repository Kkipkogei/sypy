SyPy is a framework for evaluating Social Graph-based Sybil Detection (SGSD) algorithms in social and information networks. It provides basic abstractions to define a network consisting of two regions, a Sybil region and an honest region, each having its own graph structure. SyPy supports many of the popular SGSD algorithms such as SybilGuard, SybilLimit, SybilInfer, and other proposals based on community detections such as Girvan-Newman and Lourain methods.
